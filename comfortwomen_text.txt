Comfort women are women and girls across the Asia-Pacific region who were forcibly recruited, abducted, or deceived into Japan’s military sexual slavery system during WWII. 

Comfort women were confined in military-run brothels called "comfort stations" and subjected to systematic rape and abuse by Japanese soldiers. 

The euphemism comfort women obscures the reality of militarized sexual violence; terms like "sexual slaves" more accurately describe their experiences. Chongsindae (Volunteer Labor Corps) refers to non-sexual labor roles such as munitions factory workers, not to be confused with comfort women. Confusing the two groups distorts historical records and minimizes the unique suffering of each. 

The comfort station system began in the early 1930s after the Manchurian Incident and escalated with the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Reasons for the system included: curbing mass rape, controlling STDs, and maintaining discipline within military ranks. Women were recruited through deceptive job ads, abductions, or were sold due to poverty. 

Many victims were illiterate and unaware of what "comfort women" meant, leading to unknowing conscription. Survivors report that they were not informed of their actual duties and had no means of escape once trapped. 

There were around 200,000 comfort women. This number is only an estimate.

Comfort Women victims included women from Korea, China, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, East Timor, Burma, Vietnam, and the Netherlands. 

Around 240 Korean women have publicly testified, admitting they were former comfort women. 

Former comfort women often remained silent due to stigma and trauma until the early 1990s. 

On August 14, 1991, Kim Hak Soon testified publicly, marking the start of global awareness. 

On January 8, 1992, the first Wednesday Demonstration was held by the Korean Council in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. 

In the 1990s onward, the House of Sharing was established and lawsuits were filed against Japan in Tokyo courts. 

The Wednesday Demonstrations have been held weekly since 1992 to demand a formal apology and reparations from Japan. These demonstrations are organized by the Korean Council for Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. The protests aim to raise awareness, secure justice, and preserve memory. 

Comfort women were forced to serve between 10 to 50 soldiers a day depending on rank and time. 

Comfort stations operated with military-issued currency called scripts that the women could not use. 

Living conditions in comfort stations were unsanitary and washbasins were rarely cleaned, increasing risk of STIs. Women were stripped of their names and given Japanese names displayed on wooden panels. 

Comfort stations varied between permanent structures and mobile military setups. 

The different types of comfort stations are military-run or civilian-run but all operated under military control. 

In 1992, the Japanese military issued a limited apology known as the Kono Statement, which admitted involvement.  However, the Kono Statement was later undermined by conservative efforts to revise history. 

Survivors filed lawsuits, like the one led by Kim Hak Soon, which reached partial success before being overturned. 

United Nations Reports from 1996 and 1998 confirmed the comfort women system as war crimes and demanded compensation and prosecution. 

In 2007, U.S. House Resolution 121 urged Japan to accept responsibility and educate future generations. 

Survivors faced long-term health and psychological consequences. 

Many women from Okinawa, including Koreans and locals, were also forced into sexual slavery. Civilians during the Battle of Okinawa witnessed comfort women hiding in caves or searching for food. 

South Korea began investigating in 1992 and restarted in 2004 with the Truth Commission. The government initially chose not to demand compensation, a decision criticized for overlooking victims' rights. 

A 2006 Constitutional Court ruling confirmed that the government failed to uphold survivors’ rights. Comfort women remain a pressing issue in Korean society, both culturally and institutionally. 

Activists continue to demand formal apology, truth disclosure, memorials, restitution, historical education, and criminal accountability.

The national memorial day for comfort women is on August 14th. This day commemorates the experiences of women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II. It was officially designated as a national memorial day by the South Korean government in 2017. The date was chosen because it marks the first public testimony of a former "comfort woman," Kim Hak-sun, in 1991
